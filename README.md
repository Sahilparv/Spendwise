# SpendWise: Personal Expense Tracker 💰

A sleek, functional, and persistent expense tracking application built with **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **Pandas**.

I built SpendWise to help users manage their daily finances with ease. Unlike basic trackers, this app features data persistence (saving your data to a local CSV) and real-time budget monitoring with visual alerts.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Data Persistence:** Expenses are saved locally; your data stays even after closing the browser.
- **Dynamic Visuals:** Interactive spending breakdown using Plotly pie charts.
- **Smart Budgeting:** Set a monthly limit and receive visual warnings when you hit your custom threshold.
- **Export Ready:** View your full history in an interactive table.
